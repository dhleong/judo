*A more elegant way to play in the [MUD][1]*

## What

Judo is a terminal-based, modal MUD client inspired by [Vim][2].  If you're unfamiliar
with Vim and do a lot of typing or text editing, go take a look! On a Unix system you
can probably run `vimtutor` from your favorite terminal to get an intro.

Being modal means that the keys you type don't always just go into the "input buffer"
for sending to the MUD server. Instead, each key press, or sequence of key presses,
can be bound to do many different things, which very based on the current "mode."

### Normal Mode

Normal Mode is largely identical to Vim's, where keys used to move around the input
buffer and perform large editing *verbs*, or *actions*. A *verb* takes an *object*
(more commonly referred to as *motions*), just like in most languages. For example,
you use the `delete` verb (bound to the `d` key) with the `word` object (bound to
the `w` key), you will *delete* until the start of the next "word." This is done by
simply typing `dw` in Normal Mode. There's also an `end of line` object, `$`, so
typing `d$` will delete from the current position all the way to the end of the line.

There are [many][3] [resources][4] for [learning][5] [about][6] [vim][7], but
hopefully this very brief intro will convince you to give it a shot.

Note that not all verbs and motions from Vim are implemented in Judoâ€”yet!

### Insert Mode

Insert Mode is also a largely identical to Vim's, and is equivalent in function to
most other editors. When you type in Insert Mode, the text gets *inserted* into the
input buffer.

### Command Mode

Command Mode is similar to Vim's, but instead of executing vimscript, it executes
Python code. With functions like `disconnect()` which don't take any arguments, you
can omit the parentheses.

### Custom Modes

One interesting feature of Judo is the ability to create custom modes. We'll go
into more depth on the mechanics of this feature in the scripting documentation


## How

Judo is implemented in [Kotlin][8] because I wanted to learn more about it after Google
announced their official support for it on Android. I'd been tinkering with it a bit,
but it was time to really get my hands dirty. Also, the JVM is pretty ubiquitous,
and I didn't want to have to deal with compiling stuff (although it does mean Judo
uses a good deal more memory than Vim which inspired it).

Builds will eventually be put on the releases page, but for now you can build your
own using the included Gradle script:

    ./gradlew jar

Then, to run:

    java -jar judo/build/libs/judo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Since Judo needs tight control over the terminal, you unfortunately cannot simply
do `./gradle run`, which also means running a debug build from IntelliJ won't work
as expected. Instead, you can run like this:

    java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -jar judo/build/libs/judo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

and connect IntelliJ's debugger to it by creating a "Remote" debug run configuration.

### Connecting to a Server

You have a couple options here:

1. Pass host and port to the CLI:

        java -jar judo/build/libs/judo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar myawesomeserver.com 5656

2. Use the `connect(host, port)` command

3. Create a world script containing `connect(host, port)` and pass *that* to the CLI:

        java -jar judo/build/libs/judo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar myawesomescript.py

### Configuring

Judo tries to load `$HOME/.config/judo/init.py` every time it loads, so that is a
great place to put common mappings, etc.

### Scripting

Judo uses [Python][9] for configuration and scripting. More to come on this soon, but
for now running `help` in Command Mode will get you started.


## Why

I've played MUDs off and on throughout my life, but when I started getting into them
again recently, I found that trying to navigate around worlds quickly put my hand
into a very RSI-inducing position (I don't have a keyboard with a numpad). I was
inspired by my favorite editor to create something modal, so I could bind the hjkl
keys to the cardinal directions and keep my hands comfortably on the home row.
